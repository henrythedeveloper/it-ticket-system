- a way to have scheduled tasks auto create themselves (reoccuring)
  - Our team might want to have a task that needs to be completed daily
- be able to click on the sender email and show a list of tickets from that sender
  - and be able to click on those ticket history
- be able to export the ticket hirstory in it's entirety by csv or pdf (admin)
- on the dashboard it needs to be wider and show more details on whats assigned to you from tickets and tasks
  - maybe another container that shows any urgent ones that are due today
  - you should also be able to click on those tickets and have the dialog pop up from there.
- there should be a ticket container on ticket list at the top showing ones that are due today or tomorrow
  - same with tasks
- When you click open a ticket there should be suggestions or another dialog showing previous solutions that might be applicable to the new ticket. There can be an automatic scrubbing on the description of the problem and the dialog would show up with possible solutions from the past. You can then choose the solution and it will automatically apply that solution to the ticket, you can then add any additional things to the solution and/or close the ticket when you are done. We might need to change the rule where the solution will only show if the ticket is marked as resolved.
- On the ticketlist page the tickets assigned to you should be above the tickets assigned to others. same with taskslist page
